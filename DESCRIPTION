    Virtual Machine. Interacts with the 'Elasticsearch' 'HTTP' 'API' (http://
    elasticsearch.org), including functions for setting connection details to
    'Elasticsearch' instances, loading bulk data, searching for documents with both
    'HTTP' query variables and 'JSON' based body requests. In addition, 'elastic'
